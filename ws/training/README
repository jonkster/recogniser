The scipt ocrlearn.js will either create a net or will further train an existing net.

Edit the file to change the variable 'create' to either create and train a new
net using a data set or to adjust an existing net using training data.

The 'starter' directory should contain an existing net to refine.  The
resulting network after training will be placed in this directory (named as
nnew.json)

The training data and labels are located in the 'data' directory.



The system is trained using the MNIST database of handwritten digits. 
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Basically a set of images of digits (and a set of labels that correspond to
what each image represents), are processed to train the network.


The format of the training data is:

TRAINING SET LABEL FILE (train-labels-idx1-ubyte):

[offset] [type]          [value]          [description] 
0000     32 bit integer  0x00000801(2049) magic number (MSB first) 
0004     32 bit integer  60000            number of items 
0008     unsigned byte   ??               label 
0009     unsigned byte   ??               label 
........ 
xxxx     unsigned byte   ??               label
The labels values are 0 to 9.

TRAINING SET IMAGE FILE (train-images-idx3-ubyte):

[offset] [type]          [value]          [description] 
0000     32 bit integer  0x00000803(2051) magic number 
0004     32 bit integer  60000            number of images 
0008     32 bit integer  28               number of rows 
0012     32 bit integer  28               number of columns 
0016     unsigned byte   ??               pixel 
0017     unsigned byte   ??               pixel 
........ 
xxxx     unsigned byte   ??               pixel
Pixels are organized row-wise. Pixel values are 0 to 255. 0 means background
(white), 255 means foreground (black).
